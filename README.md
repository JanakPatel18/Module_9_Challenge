## June and December Temperature Statistics

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve the temperature statistics for the Months of June and December.  The reason that June and December were picked is because W. Avy wants to know if the ice cream and surf shop he wants to open would able to sustain year-round operating power.  To give him a good report of data, the statistics for the temperature was taken from a 7year timeframe.

## Results

After analyzing the data thoroughly, the statistics were put in tables to present to W. Avy.  Once the was given to W. Avy, he was presented with the key information he was looking for to make a decision about if his shop would be able to operate year-round.  There were a few key differences that were observed during the analysis.  Some of the differences were the number of times the temperature was observed, the minimum and maximum temperature, and the average temperature for those months.  The number of times the temperature which was observed in June was higher than the number of times it was observed in the December.  The min and max temperature on the other hand, was actually close in the number.  The average temperature was also very close in number which helps in making a decision for W. Avy.

## Summary

In summary, W. Avy asked to give him statistical temperature analysis for the months of June and December to be able to make a decision on if his shop would be able to operate year-round.  The data was presented in tables to make the decision making a little easier for W. Avy.  There were a few different data points were given to him in the tables as well.  After going through the data, we informed W. Avy that his shop would be able to sustain year-round operation from the temperature analysis because there was not a very big difference in the range.  This is what we advised because if his shop can sustain operation in the first half of the year, then it would be able to sustain operation in the second half of the year just by looking at the temperature analysis.
